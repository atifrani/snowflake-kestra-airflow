# Data Engineering Project

This is an introduction to how schedule sql transformations in snowflake.

## Overview

If you work as a data analyst/engineer, you probably work with SQL. Although SQL is simple to learn, you may have already wondered how to get your SQL code to run automatically.
In this demo, we present 3 examples to automatically execute your SQL code,  
  * Using snowflake Tasks and Streams
  * Using apache aiflow dag
  * Using Kestra flow

- Kestra docker image

## How to Run This Project



## Lessons Learned

Choosing between Kestra and Airflow will depend on your specific needs, your familiarity with the platforms, and the complexity of your pipelines. If you're looking for a simple, easy-to-use platform, Kestra may be a better fit. On the other hand, if you need a more mature platform with a wide range of features and integrations, Airflow might be the better choice.
